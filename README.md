Tisp is a "Time is Space" programming language.
It aims to be simple, canonical, and practical.

This baby project is under heavy development.
Any contributions would be appreciated.

## Current status

See [the issues](https://github.com/tisp-lang/tisp/issues).
Tisp is actively developed and work in progress.
Stay tuned!

## Installation

```
go get github.com/tisp-lang/tisp/src/cmd/tisp
```

You need Go 1.8+.

## Features

- Purely functional programming
  - Impure function calls in pure functions are detected and raise errors at
    runtime.
- Implicit parallelism and concurrency
  - Most of the time, you don't need to parallelize your code explicitly.
    Tisp does it all for you!
  - Inherently, programs written in Tisp run concurrently and can run
    parallelly.
- Optional injection of parallelism and causality
  - You can also increase parallelism of your code or run functions
    sequentially using `par` or `seq` primitives.
- Asynchronous IO
- Dynamic typing
